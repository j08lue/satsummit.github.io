This workshop ([REGISTER](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/geospatial-machine-learning-with-cloud-services-tickets-849706293397?aff=oddtdtcreator)) will focus on applying machine learning to geospatial data for computer vision applications.

This virtual workshop provides hands-on experience with tools and scenarios to enhance participants' understanding of machine learning-based computer vision in the context of geospatial data. Participants will learn to gather and prepare relevant satellite data, define models, and execute training of the models while reviewing outputs and making necessary adjustments. The workshop emphasizes developing the training dataset and executing models at scale using AWS cloud services.

Two scenarios will be worked: a simpler one involving Raster Vision, PyTorch, and STAC for classifying simple objects such as cars and trees, and a more complex scenario that will additionally leverage SageMaker, S3, EC2, and Batch to address the challenge of detecting sandstorms with MODIS and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery.

This workshop is geared towards organizations and individuals working in the geospatial domain and looking to use machine learning to extract insights from satellite imagery. Whether you're a data scientist, geospatial analyst, remote sensing specialist, or a researcher interested in leveraging machine learning for geospatial applications, this workshop will equip you with practical skills and insights to tackle complex challenges in the field. Attendees of all experience levels are welcome.

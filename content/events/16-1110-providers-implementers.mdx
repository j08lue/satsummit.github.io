A direct dialogue between satellite industry leaders and global development and humanitarian response experts. Panelists will share how their organizations are working to accelerate earth-informed action. Panelists will reflect on the past decade, the progress that weâ€™ve made, and the areas where progress has been elusive. They will discuss how to work across the community in our common interest.

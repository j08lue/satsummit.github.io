Healthy ecosystems are essential for regulating climate, protecting biodiversity, and supporting human lives and economies. Yet human activities like commodity production and expanding cities are destroying the natural resources upon which people and nature depend. The current extinction rate is as much 1000x higher than the natural extinction rate, making this the Earth’s sixth great mass extinction, and it will forever be part of the fossil record. Speakers will showcase how advances in earth monitoring enhance our understanding and protection of the world’s natural ecosystems, paving the way for sustainable coexistence.

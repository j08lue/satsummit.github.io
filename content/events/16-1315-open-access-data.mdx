As the world grapples with the escalating climate crisis, the imperative for open, accessible, and accurate geospatial data for nature and climate has never been more urgent. This panel will unpack open access data's critical role in democratizing data, enhancing transparency, fostering global collaboration, and accelerating innovation. The discussion will center on the significance of satellite data in enhancing public services, fostering sustainable practices, and ensuring equitable access to critical information for decision-making across various sectors. Key themes will include data accuracy, privacy considerations, and collaborative frameworks to advance the development of comprehensive digital infrastructure for public benefit. We aim to discuss the practical downstream data products that can be created with satellite data and how we can accelerate their development.

Trillions of dollars are required to decarbonize energy infrastructure, build climate-adapted infrastructure, and preserve critical ecosystems. Up to 2/3 of this cost will fall on under-resourced local governments. Donors and private investors will be needed to meet our climate commitments, and these investors will require assurance that their investments are well spent. 

This panel aims to discuss this practical, medium-term, detail-oriented needs and
brainstorm ways that EO data and services may help stakeholders put money into the
right place and share success stories with stakeholders.

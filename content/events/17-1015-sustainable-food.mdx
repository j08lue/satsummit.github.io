As agriculture continues to be a leading driver of global deforestation, we are seeing a shift from voluntary company commitments to mandatory regulatory compliance to remove deforestation from supply chains. The landmark European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) is currently spurring activity across the sector. How can we use this moment as an opportunity to improve sustainable sourcing and forest conservation? EO and geospatial data have a huge role to play in solving this complex challenge. We will discuss the current state of work in this space and the remaining gaps to be filled, as the community works towards feeding the planet without destroying the planet.

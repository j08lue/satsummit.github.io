Many people who access public earth data access it via a commercial cloud provider. This is particularly likely true among new data users outside the traditional science research community. The accessibility of cloud services promises to accelerate the adoption and impact of Earth imagery, much like open licensing did decades ago. This movement comprises various efforts, some led by government agencies and others by cloud providers. Each has a slightly different view of its target users and has solved access problems differently. Most have adopted a similar set of emerging cloud-native standards. This panel will explore the current landscape of public data on commercial clouds, including different efforts' viewpoints, roadmaps, aspirations, and challenges.

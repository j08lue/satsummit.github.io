Deriving insights from satellite imagery using AI/ML relies heavily on ground reference data (or labels). These data are scarce outside the world's developed regions primarily due to a lack of investment and infrastructure to collect them. Foundation Models, however, promise to change this paradigm and break the barrier for everyone to benefit from AI/ML advancements, even with limited label data. We will discuss how end users can apply new Large Earth Foundation Models to solve the data scarcity problem.

As heat emergencies become more frequent, cities will have an outsized role in mitigation and response. However, most cities lack a strategy or devoted resources to deal with urban heat. Climate Change is moving faster than city bureaucracy and the victims of this situation are likely to be the most vulnerable. In this working session, we will discuss how to encourage cities to adopt an urban heat risk strategy. What data and expertise will cities need? What new data and tools are coming online? How can we assist city managers to make the business case for a heat strategy? How can we build or engage processes that lead to meaningfully adoption of these strategies? This is a facilitated conversation among participants.

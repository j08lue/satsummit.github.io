The past year has seen an unprecedented uptake of EO data for crisis monitoring. Conflict in Ukraine and Gaza shows an acute need for EO-driven documentation of the consequences of armed conflicts on cities, communities, and landscapes. This roundtable will discuss strategies to navigate the challenges of ethical concerns, data access, and political sensitivities, aiming to enhance EO data's role in conflict resolution. Further, this work's urgent and sensitive nature makes it prone to siloing and duplication of efforts. This roundtable will discuss the current state of EO in conflict monitoring and efforts to advance the state of the practice.

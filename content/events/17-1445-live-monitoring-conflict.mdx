The past year has seen an unprecedented uptake of EO data for crisis monitoring. Conflict in Ukraine and Gaza shows an acute need for EO-driven documentation of the consequences of armed conflicts on cities, communities, and landscapes. But these efforts face real challenges, including ethical concerns, uneven data access and data restrictions, and political sensitivities of public and commercial data providers. Further, this work's urgent and sensitive nature makes it prone to siloing and duplication of efforts. This working session will discuss the current state of EO in conflict monitoring and efforts to advance the state of the practice.

In 2023, we set new heat records around the globe, and this trend continues into 2024. [Current models canâ€™t explain the extent of our new heat anomaly](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00816-z), suggesting that we may be in uncharted territory. Extreme heat already poses a serious health threat, causing 500,000 extra deaths a year and could cost the global economy $2.4 trillion by 2030. 

Addressing the critical issue of urban heat, this session will focus on innovative data-driven strategies to reduce its health impacts and economic costs, aiming to safeguard communities and bolster resilience. Panelists will discuss efforts to equip cities with the data they need to plan and manage extreme heat.

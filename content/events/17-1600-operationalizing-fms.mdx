There has been a dramatic shift in the shape of the space & geospatial industry since the last SatSummit. The commercial market has been characterized by consolidation, layoffs, a decrease in Venture Capitol, and falling enterprise values. New space and new geo startups continue to have difficulty finding market traction outside of Defense and Intelligence. In this environment, weâ€™ve noticed some companies shifting away from prior commitments to global development and environmental stewardship.

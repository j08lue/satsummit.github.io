Floods will impact 2.2 billion people worldwide in the near future, with over 100 million projected to fall into extreme poverty by 2030. Yet, our ability to prepare, respond, and recover from such events is still dependent on outdated models and biased human judgment. This is a global crisis for humanity.

At ICEYE, we are creating scalable, timely, and resilient solutions that provide critical insights before, during, and after natural catastrophes, empowering response and recovery efforts. With the world’s largest constellation of synthetic aperture radar satellites, ICEYE offers persistent monitoring that forms the foundation of an always-on system for catastrophe tracking and analysis.

However, radar imagery alone cannot fully transform space-based information into a reliable, scalable commodity. To unlock a new market for disaster recovery and insurance, we must shift customer perceptions and deliver data that is both granular and precise—building trust and seamlessness in consumption of space-derived information. Scalable Earth Observation (EO) products must transcend shallow offerings and agnostic platforms, enabling governments and insurers to make data-driven decisions that inspire confidence among their stakeholders.

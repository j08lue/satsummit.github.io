**State of the Space Sector** 

**State of the Data** 

**State of Earth AI** 

**State of Application** 

Since SatSummit last convened in 2022, weâ€™ve seen large shifts and exciting new capabilities emerge. Constellations have emerged, and others have matured, notably in weather, SAR, hyperspectral, and GHG monitoring. Numerous Large Earth Models have been deployed, drawing on advances in Generative AI. The commercial space industry continues to work through its post-ZIRP (Zero interest-rate policy) hangover. As we witness an acceleration in climate change, our community is responding by setting new benchmarks in extreme weather monitoring and response capabilities. We are still determining how to gather the data to support new enforcement regimes designed to combat climate change. 

We will hear from individuals at the center of these movements. They will brief us on the current state of play and prospects for the future across the satellite sector, data, AI, and the application of EO data to social and climate issues.

Our need to understand biodiversity pushes the boundaries of what’s possible with remote sensing. The UN Convention on Biological Diversity has set ambitious targets for every country to meet by 2030, but 75% of the indicators don’t have data to monitor them. Companies are being asked to disclose biodiversity impacts but don’t know where to start, and the reality of conservation on the ground is always more complicated. Join us for a lively discussion on the state of the art, and the need for better mapping of biodiversity, ecosystem conditions, and nature’s value to people.

NASA Lifelinesâ€™ Scientist "Speed Dating" program is a networking series bringing together Earth scientists, social scientists, data scientists, economists, and other experts to meet new collaborators and identify novel research ideas to address humanitarian challenges with assistance from satellite data and tools.  

In the session, participating experts will receive guidance from humanitarian representatives as to what challenges are most pressing for their missions, along with crucial context and constraints that the scientific community would need to come up with effective, application-ready research ideas. We will provide scientists and researchers with in-kind commercial imagery that can be used alongside NASA assets to address humanitarian use cases related to a number of issues in a given context, e.g. urban heat impact, mapping vulnerable populations, energy access, and rapid conflict zone assessments.  Experts are encouraged to adopt a systems thinking approach with their research brainstorming and align closely with humanitarian needs, before they present a joint hypothesis at the end of the session that uniquely addresses a humanitarian challenge.

There has been a dramatic shift in the shape of the space & geospatial industry since the last SatSummit. The commercial market has been characterized by consolidation, layoffs, a decrease in Venture Capitol, and falling enterprise values. New space and new geo startups continue to have difficulty finding market traction outside of Defense and Intelligence. In this environment, weâ€™ve noticed some companies shifting away from prior commitments to global development and environmental stewardship. This working session will be an open discussion the current state of affairs and speculation on what lies ahead.

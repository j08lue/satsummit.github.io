The shift to cloud storage of earth data has created opportunities for new modes of data access and distribution. This transition requires the design and implementation of new cloud-optimized file formats and services. Broadly, this means that data storage and services are optimized to minimize the amount of requests for data and size of data to be transferred. But what does this look like in practice? What is our shared vision for the architecture of a cloud-native future? This session will dive into what a cloud-native future could look like. We will determine what choices are clear (use object storage) and which are unclear (do you need to reformat your data). Ultimately we hope to develop a shared vision for optimal delivery of visualization and analysis via the data in the cloud.

Lately, Foundation Models (FMs) have grown increasingly prominent, particularly in scientific applications. Yet, while constructing FMs is a significant achievement, effectively employing them in operational contexts poses its own set of challenges. Our aim in this breakout session is to explore strategies for deploying FMs in operational settings that are both cost-effective and scalable, ensuring their sustainability in the long run. Let's delve into how we can collaborate to address these considerations together.

title: Biodiversity
type: Panel
date: '2022-09-29 14:00'
room: The North Hub
lead: We have found ourselves realizing our dependence on biodiversity while at the same time increasingly documenting its decline. Right now, nations around the world are developing a global biodiversity framework to be adopted at the 15th UN Biodiversity Conference (CBD COP-15) this December in Canada. Corporations are seeking ways to measure and monitor their biodiversity impacts as a component of ESG reporting. Earth Observation (EO) has an essential role in assessing and communicating the status and trends of biodiversity. 

This panel will discuss the present and future potential of EO data for biodiversity conservation decision support. How EO data together with *in situ* data can be transformed into conservation intelligence directly applicable to stakeholders from national to local levels? How can open data and international public-private partnerships support the transformational change needed to reverse the current trend of biodiversity loss? What are the main opportunities and challenges to make this change a reality?

Arjen Luijendijk has extensive expertise in using geospatial data to address coastal change, which resulted in the first global beach erosion database using historic satellite imagery. Arjen works on predicting future behavior of the worldâ€™s beaches impacted by human developments and a changing climate, where he focusses on increasing the resilience of coastal zones by developing advanced modelling methods on aggregated time- and spatial scales and Earth Observation methods.

Arjen applies emerging technologies to the field of Coastal Engineering with societal impact, while underpinning new knowledge and tools with scientific publications and outreach. Furthermore, he is involved in various teams that co-design user-oriented innovation products, such as the Virtual Climate Lab.

Arjen holds positions at Deltares and at the Delft University of Technology as associate professor. His research there focusses on Global Coastal Change in times of Climate Change and data-model fusion for engineering Nature-Based Solutions in coastal environments.

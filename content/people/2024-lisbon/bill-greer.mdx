Bill Greer has had a long career focused on GIS, Mapping, remote sensing, and product management, dedicated to creating social impact through innovation. He is a co-founder at Ctrl Shift, a non-profit (501c3 pending) that offers free, taskable satellite imagery to humanitarian aid and disaster response communities. With extensive experience from working at Premise Data, GeoCommons, Timbr.io, and Albedo, William has played key roles in startups acquired by major industry players like ESRI and Maxar. 

With a focus on leveraging satellite technology for social good, William is now on a mission to bridge the gap between commercial satellite operations and the humanitarian sector. Ctrl Shift is designing satellites and systems to eliminate the licensing and data-sharing restrictions that hinder effective disaster response, giving humanitarians on the ground the tools they need to save lives and improve outcomes.

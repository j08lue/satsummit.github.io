At the Portuguese Space Agency, Carolina Sá is responsible for following the Earth Observation programmes. Coming from the world of Marine Sciences, she was led to the field of satellite remote sensing by the desire to study microscopic aquatic plants (i.e. phytoplankton) from a different perspective - from Space!
She specialised in ocean colour remote sensing systems and worked as a researcher for over ten years, focusing on satellite data validation activities and marine environment applications. Promoting ways to bridge the gap between Earth Observation research and applications, science and industry, technology and society is one of her main tasks.

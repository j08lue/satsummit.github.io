Grega Milcinski co-founded Sinergise in September 2008 and, after acquisition of Sinergise by Planet Labs PBC in August 2023, joined Planet.  The Sinergise team is best known for Sentinel Hub, Area Monitoring Services and EO Browser. Several years ago, they recognised the potential of open EO data, but hit a wall trying to use existing technologies to work with these large datasets. Fast-forward a couple of years and Sentinel Hub is now processing more than half a billion of requests every month, powering thousands of applications and machine learning workflows worldwide, providing seamless access to Sentinel, Landsat, Planet and many other satellite missions. Sinergise is part of the consortium led by T-Systems, which is operating Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem on behalf of European Space Agency and European Commission.

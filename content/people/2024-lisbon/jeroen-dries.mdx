Jeroen is leading the R&D and operations of VITO's openEO-based platforms for on-demand processing & analytics of EO data. This includes the Copernicus Dataspace Ecosystem openEO service, which . He is a software engineer with 10 years of experience in one of the largest providers of EO analytics and insights.

With the openEO standard & ecosystem as a basis for FAIR and reproducible open science, Jeroen and his team help projects in agriculture, land-use and biodiversity to build global-scale applications. This either results in continental or global scale maps, or more advanced on-demand services like WorldCereal that allow users to generate tailored maps.

This way of working was the basis for ESA APEx, which aims to turn EO project results into comparable and reproducible on-demand services that can be integrated into last-mile applications.

Karsten Peters-von Gehlen is a meteorologist by training and utilised both satellite and model data in his undergraduate, graduate and PostDoctoral work focusing on aerosols, clouds and atmospheric convection (2008-2018). 
He joined the data management department of the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ) in 2018. In his current role as group leader of the Data Handling Workflows Group, he is responsible for conceiving and developing novel approaches to improve handling of large-volume and complex data sets stemming from state-of-the-art model simulations and observational efforts. Therefore, he collaborates closely with developers and researchers working on cutting-edge scientific topics pushing the boundaries of what is technically possible on current HPC infrastructures.
Karsten is also an active contributor to current efforts in the global research data management community aiming at enabling efficient future scientific workflows by exploiting the concepts of FAIR digital objects and Open Science.

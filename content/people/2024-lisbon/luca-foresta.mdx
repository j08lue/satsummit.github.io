Luca's main interest has always been understanding Earth processes and climate, especially leveraging EO data. Early on, he was focusing on glaciers and ice sheets, while in the last few years Luca has been working on monitoring deforestation as well as biomass modelling. Furthermore, he has been responsible for deploying algorithms on scalable environments like supercomputing clusters or, more recently, kubernetes clusters hosted in the cloud.

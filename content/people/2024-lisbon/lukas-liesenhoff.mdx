I lead the data science team at OroraTech where we build our own satellites for lightning fast wildfire detection from space. I have a background in Computer Vision (TUM), Applied Data Science (Oxford) and Economics (LMU) with stunts at the World Bank, Planet Labs and the World Food Programme during my PhD. Talk to me about fire detection, cubesats,  machine learning for the developing world, time-series analysis of images, change detection,  and your favourite outdoor sport.

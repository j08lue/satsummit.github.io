Brian Hettler leads the mapping / Geographic Information Systems (GIS) team at the Amazon Conservation Team (ACT). Over the past 12 years, Brian has led participatory mapping initiatives in Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, Peru, and Suriname, working in close collaboration with indigenous communities to create cultural maps that record and preserve traditional knowledge, and support indigenous rights and community-based conservation efforts. Brian and the ACT mapping team use remote sensing technologies to support environmental monitoring of threatened South American ecosystems, and create interactive, map-based digital stories designed to raise awareness of Amazonian cultures and ecosystems and the many external threats they face.

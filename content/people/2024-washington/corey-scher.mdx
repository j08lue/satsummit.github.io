I'm a fifth year doctoral candidate at the City University of New York Graduate Center in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. My work integrates methods from geophysics with satellite radar technology and engineering of data processing pipelines to develop scalable workflows for near-real time monitoring of war and conflict impacts to the built environment.

Jamon Van Den Hoek is an Associate Professor of Geography at Oregon State University where he leads the Conflict Ecology lab (www.conflict-ecology.org). Jamon's research lies at the intersection of humanitarian and peace and conflict research, land cover/land use change, and remote sensing and geospatial sciences. He uses open satellite data to monitor damage to cities and landscapes caused by armed conflict, develop new approaches to map refugee movements and refugee-environment relationships, and assess long-term environmental and climatic changes in politically fragile contexts around the world. Jamon was a NASA Postdoctoral Fellow at Goddard Space Flight Center and completed his PhD in Geography at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

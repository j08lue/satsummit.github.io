As a dedicated remote sensing specialist, my passion lies in harnessing the power of cutting-edge technologies to better understand our planet. I am particularly intrigued by the potential of machine learning and deep learning models to study and investigate land cover changes due to climate change. Currently, I am a post-doctoral researcher at Clark University, where I focus on building geospatial foundation models to improve the accuracy of remote sensing data analysis for environmental monitoring applications.

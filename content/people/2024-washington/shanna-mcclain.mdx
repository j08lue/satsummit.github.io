Dr. Shanna N. McClain is the Disasters Program Manager for NASA's Earth Sciences Division. In this role, she leads a dynamic team to advance the use of Earth science information for reducing disaster risk, improving disaster response, and building resilience. She helps define NASA's role in resilience through the development of Earth Observation-focused approaches in fragile and crisis-affected areas and identifying strategic and non-traditional partnerships that can improve linkages between science and policy.
Shanna also manages two consortia at NASA. NASA Lifelines is a 6-year cooperative agreement between NASA and DevGlobal focused on advancing the integration of Earth science information into humanitarian action. Additionally, she manages the Collaborative Network for Valuing Earth Information (CONVEI), a 5-year cooperative agreement between NASA, NOAA, USGS, and WWF focused on assessing the value of Earth science information for societal benefit.

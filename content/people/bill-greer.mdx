Bill Greer has been described as 'walking the fine line between a good time and a serious liabilityâ€™  by co-workers and friends. Presently serving as the Head of Product at Premise Data, he harnesses the power of geospatial data to drive impactful initiatives across the public sector, commercial enterprises, and international development efforts spanning 140 countries. Additionally, his work aims to foster local economies in tandem with these global pursuits.

As an alumni of GeoIQ (GeoCommons - Acquired by Esri), Esri, Timbr.io (Acquired by DigitalGlobe), Maxar, and Albedo, Bill has had the opportunity to work at some of the most pioneering dual-use startups as well as the industry giants, while advocating for using spatial tools and data to improve the real world. He has seen the value of open data, open methodologies, analytics, and data driven decisions in the field to make life saving interventions. You could say he's really pushing the boundaries in the industry. Through this experience Bill has seen a huge swath of the commercial geospatial industry, from building a satellite, all the way down to working with that data in the field, and every step along the way. 

 He firmly believes in the transformative potential of community collaboration and technological tools to enhance the status quo. Make good decisions.

With over 20 years of experience in technology and data for sustainability and social justice, I am passionate about bringing together science, policy and citizenship through design and technology. As the founder and CEO of Vizzuality, I lead a team of highly skilled and motivated individuals who share vision and values. We are trusted by the world’s most important organisations to create unique tools and applications with a lasting benefit to society and the environment.

At Vizzuality, I oversee business and project development and set the strategic direction for the company, ensuring each project will make a difference, and enabling a creative and impactful use of technology. We take enjoyment in being a small and productive company that delivers great user experiences for stories that matter.

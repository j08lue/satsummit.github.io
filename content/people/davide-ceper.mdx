I have been always guided by the desire to contribute to the solution of the environmental catastrophe that is unfolding under our eyes, first by joining McKinsey's Sustainability Practice, and later by leading innovation-driven businesses in the ag industry, which has been my passion for the past ten years.   For this reason, I have led Varda’s conceptualization and built a team of purpose-driven, enthusiastic professionals who share in Varda’s mission of using data and technology to help preserve our natural capital and the soils that sustain our global society. We tend to ignore the precarious natural and climatic equilibrium on which we have relied since the agricultural revolution. Unfortunately, that equilibrium is now seriously compromised, and our current economic system is so complex that people cannot easily see the link between their eating (or clothing) choices and the destruction of the environment. Through Varda, we wish to make that link more transparent, and to help reward those farmers who fight daily to strike a delicate balance between short-term productivity and long-term natural capital preservation.

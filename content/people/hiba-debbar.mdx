I understand the critical importance of combining boots-on-the-ground operations with technology. At Degas, I lead partnerships acquisition and oversee technology implementation on the ground. Before joining Degas, I worked as a consultant at NTT Data Group based in Tokyo, engaging with a variety of private and public sector clients. Over the years, I have successfully implemented over 20 ODA projects for bilateral organizations and international development banks, primarily in Africa, South East Asia, and the Pacific, across different sectors. Originally from Morocco, I leverage my understanding of advanced technologies and the unique contexts of emerging market landscapes and their complexities to drive growth, democratize advanced technologies, and maximize impact.

Jackson is a geospatial data scientist at Mighty Earth. He joined the team in 2020, initially working on Mighty's Rapid Response Deforestation Monitoring program for palm oil. His research quickly expanded to include other commodities with high impact on tropical forests including cocoa, soy, beef, nickel, and bauxite. He now leads Mightyâ€™s Rapid Response program alongside allies at AidEnvironment, MapHubs, Trase, and TheTreeMap. His work has been covered by outlets including the BBC, the Financial Times, Reuters, Le Monde, and Mongabay.
 
Jackson graduated with a B.A. in Geography and Computer Science from Dartmouth College. Before Mighty Earth, he was a fellow at the GMU/Harvard Center for Spatiotemporal Computing, researching environmental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Jackson has also spent many years exploring wild, sacred places and introducing others to the natural world, working as a river guide across Latin America and in his hometown of Coloma, California.

John Crowley is head of US partnerships for MapAction, the team that deploys volunteer GIS professionals to UN operations centers during major crises. Over 15 years working in humanitarian technology, John has built a career around catalyzing innovation and collaboration between large institutions. From 2009-2014, he ran the Camp Roberts Experiments, where US federal agencies built the policies to release imagery to OpenStreetMap (MapGive) and FEMA redesigned the Civil Air Patrol’s photogrammetry protocols. John has since held positions at the United Nations Secretary-General’s office, Red Cross (IFRC), World Bank, NetHope, Mercy Corps, Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, National Defense University, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. John holds an MPA from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, where he was a Robert Seaman Fellow in Science, Technology, and Public Policy. In a previous life, he was a professional cellist.

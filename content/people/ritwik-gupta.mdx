Ritwik Gupta is an Artificial Intelligence and Public Policy Ph.D. student at the University of California Berkeley AI Research Lab focusing on computer vision for large images, particularly for humanitarian assistance and disaster response applications. His work focuses on reducing the amount of time, effort, and danger first responders face when heading into chaotic, unpredictable events such as natural disasters and wars. His research on topics such as automated building damage assessment and detection of illegal fishing vessels have been deployed worldwide for numerous events such as the Australian bushfires, the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake, and at task forces to curb IUU fishing. 

Ritwik leads Berkeley’s AI Research Climate Initiative and is a Fellow at the Center for Security in Politics, the Berkeley Risk and Security Lab, the Berkeley Human Rights Center, and the Berkeley AI Policy Hub. He serves as the Deputy Technical Director for Autonomy at the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit and has been detailed as an Advisor for AI and AI Policy to the Department of Justice. He previously led a research lab at Carnegie Mellon University on AI for disaster response and led real-time ML efforts at Apple for the Vision Pro.

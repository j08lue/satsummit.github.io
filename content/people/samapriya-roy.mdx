A Google Developer Expert for Google Earth Engine and Senior Product Manager at MAXAR, I lead Developer Relations and champion open data access apart from working on core APIs and infrastructure. I leverage geospatial expertise as an affiliate Faculty at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa and I am a Designated Campus Colleague at the University of Arizona. Passionate about community building, I created the ""Awesome Google Earth Engine Community Catalog,"" a thriving data commons to build accessibility to data for global users. 

My research explores big data analysis and geospatial applications, while I advocate for science communication and empower researchers through collaborative platforms
and engagements. Additionally, I actively work on open-source tools to connect users with data and enhance accessibility.

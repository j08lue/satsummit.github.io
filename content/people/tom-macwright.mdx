My career has been centered around building creative tools and testing the limits of what you can build on the web. That started with Development Seed, then Mapbox, where I worked on maps, Observable, visualizations, Config, CAD and hardware, Placemark, dragged back to maps by my own insatiable interest, and now Val Town, making coding simple enough to be creative with.

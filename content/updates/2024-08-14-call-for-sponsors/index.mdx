Satsummit could not happen without the help of its sponsors.

SatSummit is not just another conference â€” it's a community-driven event fueled by the passion of its organizers. These dedicated individuals make no profit from the event, instead providing both financial and in-kind support to ensure its success. They are motivated by the need to continue bringing the satellite industry and global development communities together.

However, this vision is only sustainable with the help of sponsors. The sponsors of SatSummit, gain valuable exposure, connect with industry leaders, and play a crucial role in advancing satellite technology for the greater good.

Sponsoring is a chance to make a difference and be part of this influential gathering.  
Checkout the [prospectus](lisbon-sponsor-prospectus.pdf) to know how you can contribute to the future of global development through satellite technology.

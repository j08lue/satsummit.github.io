## Present Your Lightning Talk âš¡

In just 5 minutes, highlight a technical problem or opportunity or showcase a use case in the Earth Observation (EO) space. Spark discussions and engage with the brightest minds in EO to foster potential collaborations and innovative solutions.

We have two lightning talk themes to choose from:
- **Technical**: A technical problem or opportunity you've identified in the EO space.
- **Application**: A use case demonstrating how you're leveraging EO for impact.

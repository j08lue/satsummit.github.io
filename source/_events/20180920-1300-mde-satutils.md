summary: "The session aims to share the motivations behind STAC, its current state of development, and an overview of current STAC projects under development. An extended discussion will include what Development Seed is doing to support the STAC spec through the development of a series of sat-utils libraries. Sat-api is a library that is an easily deployable AWS stack to run your own elasticsearch-backed STAC API. Sat-search is a library and command line tool for searching and downloading data from STAC compliant endpoints and sat-fetch allows for batching the clipping and warping of data using user supplied AOIs."

This session will explore applications of satellite imagery to poverty prediction in developing countries. Participants will share completed work as well as ongoing research across multiple continents. This workshop will compare results from traditional spatial features approaches to newer machine learning approaches. In the final segment, participants will discuss statistical methods and tools for generating local estimates of poverty and average economic well-being by combining survey data, older census data, and indicators derived from satellite imagery.

Cloud computing is creating new models to distribute Earth data. Academics and analysts previously had to go through the painful process of downloading imagery using highly expensive and specialized software. Today, we can analyze and process huge data archives on the cloud and immediately deliver insight and images directly to the devices of end users. To accomplish this it requires that we organize data in new structures that facilitate analysis and comparison. Several patterns of "Analysis-Ready Data" (ARD) are emerging with slightly different goals and benefits. Three hands-on data access workshops will show you these emerging data models in action.

Cloud computing is creating new models to distribute earth data. Once, academics and analysts would download and torture imagery using highly expensive and specialized software. Today we can analyze and process huge data archives on the cloud and immediately deliver insight and images to directly to the devices of end users. To accomplish this requires that we organize data in new structures that facilitate analysis and comparison. Several patterns of "Analysis-Ready Data" (ARD) are emerging with slightly different goals and benefits. Three hand-on data access workshops will show you these emerging data models in action.

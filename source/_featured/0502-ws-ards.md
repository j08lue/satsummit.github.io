Participants will access and exploit EO data stored in an Open Data Cube to generate data related to the Sustainable Development Agenda. Data Cubes are a new way to store, organise, manage and analyse EO data. Data Cubes provide access to large spatio-temporal archives that are processed and organized to allows immediate analysis across time and across data sets with minimum user effort. This removes barriers to full exploitation of EO data and supports use by non-expert users. For this hands-on workshop participants will access a subset of the Common Sensing Data cube that includes Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Landsat 5/7/8 and SPOT datasets for areas in Fiji, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands.

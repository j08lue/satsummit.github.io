title: "ARD Workshop: Google Earth Engine and Python"

In this workshop, we will walk attendees through obtaining satellite imagery, processing and preparing it for analysis, and linking it to analysis engines and platforms. Participants will prepare ARD data using two repeatable methodologies: one cloud-native workflow using in Google Earth Engine; and the other using open-source Python tools and libraries on a local environment. For this hands-on workshop participants will access open imagery from Planet Labs, Landsat and Sentinel-2.

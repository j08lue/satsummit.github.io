There is a large and growing catalog of satellites and sensors, and we need new ways to examine this scale of data. It is now possible to access and analyze deep imagery archives, thanks to advances in machine learning, cloud computing and data distribution. Three hands-on workshops on "Machine Learning and Analysis" expose participants to a variety of accessible tools and platforms for producing insights from geospatial data to solve today's biggest global challenges.

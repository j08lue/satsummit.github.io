Today we launch Insights: a forum for the SatSummit community to convene and deliberately act on ideas and potential partnerships that come out of conversations and panels at the summit. A place to capture key takeaways and move ideas forward with the broader community, uphold promises, and ensure satellite industry experts and global development leaders continue to solve some of the world's most critical development challenges.

Our focus this year is turning data into action and identifying specific initiatives and partnerships that use satellite data and practical applications making progress on global challenges. Key actors working in this capacity will convene for discussions on issues surrounding a sustainable planet, disaster response and human rights, and machine learning and how it helps us understand the world we live in. We'll also learn from one another how to get the best data to decision makers and hear stories from people applying real data in the field.

The audience will include a mix of global development leaders from institutions like the World Bank, USAID, World Resources Institute, Jane Goodall Institute, and others from the satellite sector, representing both the public and commercial side of the industry with groups such as NASA, ESA, Planet, Orbital Insights, among others, who are all passionate about utilizing remote sensing data for social good.

We hope you'll take a moment after or during SatSummit to reflect on insights you're walking away with and hope to act on, and share those thoughts here.

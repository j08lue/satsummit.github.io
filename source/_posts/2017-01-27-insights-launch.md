Welcome to SatSummit _Insights_ -- a forum for the key recommendations and actions to come out of SatSummit. This space will provide recaps of the sessions and reflections from participants. 

A big focus of SatSummit is turning data into action. With that in mind, we'll look to capture specific actions and partnerships with the potential to advance social and environmental challenges. One part of this will be our list of announcements and commitments made around SatSummit.

We selected topics for SatSummit this year that lend themselves to action. We'll feature discussions around: 

- a sustainable planet;
- humanitarian response and human rights;
- malaria mapping;
- machine learning to better understand our world;
- getting the right data to decision makers;
- and applying data to make real change.

The best part of SatSummit is the connections and ideas that come form bringing development leaders and satellite innovators into one room. Insights endeavors to capture the best ideas that emerge throughout this frontier.

We hope you'll take a moment to reflect on your SatSummit insights and actions, and share those thoughts here. If you'd like to contribute, please contact Laura Gillen (laura@developmentseed.org).

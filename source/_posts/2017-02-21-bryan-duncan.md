[Bryan]({{ site.baseurl }}/speakers/bryan-duncan/) gave a Lightning Talk on NASA's Health and Air Quality Applied Sciences work, which facilitates the use of satellite data by the health and air quality communities. He shared HAQAST, a free NASA resource available to public, and touched upon his contributions to a satellite-based, multi-pollutant health air quality index, which he partners with UNICEF and health folks to create an alert system on a number of issues related to air quality.

[Carrie]({{ site.baseurl }}/speakers/carrie-stokes/) presented on "The Geographers" and discussed USAID's role working to end extreme poverty, through the promotion of resilient, democratic societies by advancing security and prosperity, and how they incorporate satellite data to work on development challenges. She pulled on a number of examples from around the world, from looking at early flood warning in Bangladesh, monitoring Algal Blooms in El Salvador, forecasting frost in Kenya, tracking illegal mining in Peru, combatting malaria in Mozambique, and securing land rights in Tanzania.

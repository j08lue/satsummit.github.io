[Nemo]({{ site.baseurl }}/speakers/nemo-semret/) shared his perspective on agricultural data from around the world for "A Sustainable Planet" and how Gro Intelligence is using "Clews," a web-based product that pulls scattered data on food and agriculture and classifies it using a common language, transforming fragmented data into information.

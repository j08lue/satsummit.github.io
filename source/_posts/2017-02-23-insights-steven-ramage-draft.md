I attended my first SatSummit in Washington DC earlier this month and it was only the second ever SatSummit. It was fabulous. Open. Engaging. Informative. Diverse. I had the privilege of sitting on a panel with ESA, NASA and the CEO of an organisation being set up by Omidyar and the Gates Foundation to talk about open data and government.

The event was made possible by a number of sponsors and as the CEO of one of them, Mapbox, Eric Gundersen gave a heart-warming intro with one caveat, “no bullshit”. I quite like this since he is running a software company and not once did he pitch his wares.

Our MC and overall event organiser and good fellow was Ian Schuler (also the person who kindly invited me to participate).

First up was Carissa Christensen from the Space and Technology Practice at Tauri Group who provided insight and numerous stats regarding the state of the satellite industry, I would recommend visiting the Tauri website if you want to learn more about the satellite aspects of global Earth observations.

Kevin Bullock from Digital Globe was the first of the major commercial satellite constellation owners to speak and he entertained us with several references to physics and explaining the increase in the amount of high resolution imagery available from the Digital Globe constellation following the launch of WorldView-4. He also announced opendata.digitalglobe.com, which I hope will be brokered via geoportal.org The best image of the day also goes to Kevin for his slide showing #WV4 launching from Vandenberg AFB captured by #WV2

The next presenter was someone I had heard about, but never met and again a very good presenter who talked about some of the real challenges in international development and disaster response, which could be helped by the technology and solutions provided by his organisation, Planet. Andrew Zolli leads global impact initiatives at Planet and he talked about their work around the world, which is indeed making an impact. I don’t remember him mentioning it, but shortly after his session there was a public announcement about Planet acquiring Terra Bella from Google.

Both Digital Globe and Planet, as well as several other commercial providers are working to support the UN Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As an aside, this is something close to my own heart since I have been working with the United Nations team leading Global Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM) for over five years and this team now chairs the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the Sustainable Development Goal Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) Working Group on Geospatial Information (WGGI); just rolls off the tongue. My organisation, the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) is also part of the WGGI working on Earth observations and the SDGs.  

Back to SatSummit.  Melanie Preisser from Vulcan Aerospace, the first of numerous female speakers, provided an overview of  how many satellites actually make it into space, and the coalition making launches happen. She almost had some photos to beat Kevin, showing the sheer enormity of some of the space vehicles. Melanie was followed by Matt O’Connell, who for many people in the industry, he requires no introduction.  Matt was formerly President and CEO of GeoEye. He regaled us with tales of ‘making it work’ and what inspired him. Matt and his team built an organisation of 60 employees producing $9 million of revenue per year to 760 employees producing $360 million per annum. He talked about building a billion dollar satellite company, which was sold to Digital Globe in January 2013.

Next up was Mark Gildersleeve from the Weather Company, part of IBM. He spoke extensively about the recently launched GOES-R [Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series] and lauded the efforts of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  GOES-R series data will be used in real time for critical weather forecasting and warning applications, which is invaluable for Weather Company customers and others.

After Mark was Bronwyn Agrios from Astro Digital. Bronwyn talked about building a platform for satellite data and about how satellites will continue to create an overwhelming amount of raw data. She explained the platform Astro Digital has been working on, focussing on the importance of good UI design and APIs, notably the concept of  #fatdata – every pixel contains lots of information – big data and metadata.


One of the great things about SatSummit was the cross section of industry organisations involved in the space sector. Tahara Dawkins who is responsible for commercial remote sensing in the Regulatory Affairs Office of NOAA spoke about government challenges in this area and how they are working to keep pace with technology and make it possible for industry to work effectively with them.

Also representing government was Ambassador Mark Brzezinski from the Arctic Executive Steering Committee at The White House….

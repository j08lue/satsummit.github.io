Andrew Zolli oversees the global social, climate, environmental and humanitarian portfolio of Planet Labs, a breakthrough global sensing company that is deploying the largest constellation of Earth-observing satellites in human history. When fully operational later this year, this system will capture a complete picture of the Earth's surface, every day, in high resolution, and make it universally accessible via the Web. This data has transformational potential as a tool for climate finance, disaster response, ecosystem management, land rights management, smallholder agriculture, peacekeeping, and countless other global challenges. It is also essential as a monitoring, evaluating and reporting of progress on many of the Sustainable Development Goals. Planet Labs is currently working with a host of leading foundations, social innovators, and technologists in these and many other fields to empower entirely new approaches to complex challenges.

Andrew is also the author of Resilience: Why Things Bounce Back, and writes and speaks widely on issues of resilience, complexity and systems-leadership and transformation. He is the former Curator and Executive Director of PopTech, and advises a range of social enterprises, companies, governments and institutions. He is a Board member of several leading enterprises, including the Garrison Institute, (https://www.garrisoninstitute.org/) which explores the intersection between contemplative practice and engaged social change.

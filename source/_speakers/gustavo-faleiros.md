Gustavo Faleiros is a journalist who specializes in geojournalism. In 2012, he launched InfoAmazonia, a digital news platform that uses satellite and other publicly available data to monitor information from the 09 countries of the Amazon rainforest. The network sprang from earlier accomplishments at the Brazilian news site O Eco, where he was a reporter and editor from 2006 to 2012. 

After that, during two years, as a Knight Fellow of the International Center for Journalists (2012-2014), he worked as reporter and trainer on data journalism for Folha de Sao Paulo, the largest newspaper in Brazil. Also during this period he helped to created the Environmental News Innovation Lab, which produced not only InfoAmazonia platform, but also a software for publishing geolocated content, called JEO. 

Since 2015, as the manager of a global network of environmental journalists - the Earth Journalism Network - he is directly involved on creating several geojournalism platforms in countries in Africa and Latin America. Two examples are InfoCongo.org, in Central Africa, and CartoChaco, in Paraguay. Due to this expertise on mapping narratives, the lab has been developing training materials, most of them published at [Geojournalism.org](http://geojournalism.org/). 

Faleiros began his career as a reporter for financial newspaper Valor Econômico, where he covered energy and sanitation. He studied journalism at Catholic University of São Paulo and holds a Master on Environmental Politics at King's College London

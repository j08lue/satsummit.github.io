Jamon Van Den Hoek is a geographer and remote sensing scientist. He pursues satellite imagery and machine learning approaches to document social-environmental consequences of armed violent conflict, and uses novel assemblages of geospatial datasets to counter dominant statist perspectives of human and environmental security. 

His current conflict ecology research examines the effects of the American drone campaign on agrarian livelihoods in Pakistan, the manifestation of damage in Aleppo over the course of the Syrian civil war, and spatially explicit relationships linking violent extremism and food security in Nigeria. 

Van Den Hoek is an Assistant Professor of Geography and Geospatial Science at Oregon State University and was previously a NASA Postdoctoral Fellow at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center from 2012-2015. He completed his PhD in Geography at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he was a National Science Foundation IGERT Fellow from 2007-2010.

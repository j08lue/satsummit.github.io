Nemo joined Gro Intelligence after 8+ years in engineering at Google, where he first worked for several years in web search on ranking algorithms. He was then Tech Lead on Google’s Ad Exchange. He led the engineering team responsible for auction algorithms and mathematical optimization. Most recently, he was Tech Lead for Contributor by Google, a new product that he invented and led from a "20%" research project to a full product launch. Contributor is a new product that enables market-based micropayment for content, letting users pay instead of seeing ads. 

Previously, Nemo was co-founder of Invisible Hand Networks, Inc., a software startup that developed real-time auction-based bandwidth exchanges for content providers and ISPs, which grew out of his academic research on game theoretic mechanisms in communication networks.  Nemo was also co-founder of a VOIP startup, and Adjunct Professor of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University.

Nemo is the author of dozens of highly cited research publications, and inventor on 7 US patents, with several more pending.  He obtained a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University, where his thesis won the Eliahu I. Jury award for his dissertation.  He also holds a Masters in engineering from McGill, where he specialized in control theory applied to biomechanical robots, and a B. Eng (Honours) in Honours Electrical Engineering and Math, where he graduated with distinction and a university scholar award.

            <h2>Force Majeure</h2>
            <p>
              In the event that we are prevented from carrying out our
              obligations as a result of any cause beyond our control (including
              without limitation acts of God, changes in applicable law, war,
              acts of terrorism, disease or pandemic, airline flight
              cancellations, strikes, lock-outs, or failure of third parties to
              deliver goods and services) we shall be relieved of our
              obligations for as long as such cause preventing our performance
              persists.
            </p>

            <h2>Governing Law; Venue</h2>
            <p>
              These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the
              laws of California, without giving effect to any principles of
              conflicts of law. Any action arising out of or relating to these
              Terms must be filed in the state or federal courts for San
              Francisco County, California, USA, and you hereby consent and
              submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of these
              courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.
            </p>

            <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
            <p>
              These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us and you
              with respect to the Conference and supersede all prior or
              contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic,
              oral or written between you and us with respect to the Conference.
              If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or
              for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed
              severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and
              enforceability of any remaining provisions. Headings are for
              convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may modify these Terms and other terms related hereto (like our
              Privacy Policy) from time to time, by posting the changed terms on
              our website. All changes will be effective immediately upon
              posting to our website. Your attendance at the Conference means
              that you accept and agree to such changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              A provision of these Terms may be waived only by a written
              instrument executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such
              provision. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or
              provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such
              right or provision.
